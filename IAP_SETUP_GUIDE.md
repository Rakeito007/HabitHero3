   - Click "+" to add tester
   
2. **Create Test Account**:

   - Set password and security questions
   - Select your region
   - Save

---

### STEP 3: Build Configuration

Your app.json is already configured with:
```json
"ios": {
  "bundleIdentifier": "com.vibecode.habithero",
  "infoPlist": {
    "SKAdNetworkItems": []
  }
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: This ONLY works with EAS Build, not Expo Go.

Build your app:
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

---

### STEP 4: Enable Production Purchases

The code is currently using **simulated purchases** for development. To enable REAL purchases:

1. **Open**: `/src/services/iapService.ts`

2. **Install the real package**:
```bash
bun add expo-in-app-purchases
```

3. **Uncomment the real implementation code**:
   - Look for comments like `// In real implementation:`
   - Uncomment the actual StoreKit code
   - Remove/comment out the `simulatePurchase()` calls

4. **Add verification** (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED):
   - Set up a backend server
   - Verify receipts with Apple's verifyReceipt API
   - Prevent fraud and hacking

---

## üì± Testing Your Purchases

### Development Testing (Current State)
1. Run your app on a device or simulator
2. Go through onboarding
3. Select a Pro plan
4. Purchase simulates after 1.5 seconds
5. Subscription activates locally

### Production Testing (After Setup)
1. Build with EAS Build
2. Install on physical device
3. Sign out of App Store
4. Purchase using sandbox account
5. Apple's payment sheet appears
6. Test with real payment flow (no charges on sandbox)

---

## üîí Security Recommendations

### Critical: Add Server-Side Verification

**Why?** Client-side only verification can be hacked. Users could get Pro features without paying.

**How to fix**:

1. **Set up a backend server** (Node.js, Python, etc.)

2. **Add verification endpoint**:
```javascript
POST /verify-receipt
{
  "receipt": "base64_encoded_receipt",
  "userId": "user_id"
}
```

3. **Server verifies with Apple**:
```javascript
// Server code example
const response = await fetch('https://buy.itunes.apple.com/verifyReceipt', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    'receipt-data': receipt,
    'password': 'your_app_shared_secret'
  })
});
```

4. **Update IAP service** to call your server instead of storing locally
